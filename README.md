# TaggingAudiobooks
Tagging actions for MP3Tag aimed at audiobooks. They have all been created on Windows, and, while most of them work on Mac too, I haven't tested all of them for now. These actions were born out of necessity, and will ensure good results if your audiobooks are synced on plex/Prologue or Chronicle. 


## **Purpuse**
To make the manual tagging of audiobooks as painless and as automatic as posible. By streamlining monotonous tasks, one can spend less time tagging and more time listening. I've been tagging audiobooks for a while now and have been continuosly encountering the same issues, so I've been building shortcuts to ease the burden of solving those repetitive tasks. Here, I intend to share all of them. I am adding them slowly because I want to document them

Also, I am no software developer, just one who enjoys tinkering with stuff. So, here they are, hopefully you find something useful.



Notes: 
Actions contains the .mta files per se. 
Documentation contains the explanation of each shortcut.
WIP is a mix of stuff in progress. Nothing there is usable yet. IÂ´m keeping all sorts of notes and clutter there.
