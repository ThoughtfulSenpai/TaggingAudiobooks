Tagging actions for MP3Tag aimed at audiobooks

**Compendium** <br>
There are some times when books are collections of stories, poems or essays by different authors. This action helps in setting the Filename property into a _"Name of the chapter" ("autor")_ format. This is in turn useful when you decide to build a .mb4 file from them and only keep the editor as Main Author of the compilation.

That way, when you build the audiobook into a .mb4, you set the Author to the Editor of the compendium, yet still know the original author for each chapter.
