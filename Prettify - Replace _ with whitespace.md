## **Prettify - Clean-hyphens-from-fields.**
If there is anything worse than metadata with underscores is metadata with hyphens. This action deals with them. Be careful with this one, though. Unlike underscores, which have no real use here, sometimes hyphens _may_ have a legit function in names, titles, etc. Use accordingly and watch out for those situations when you **actually** want to keep the hyphens.

## **Prettify - Trim**
When dealing with files that have whitespaces either at the start or end of a string. Get rid of those empty spaces.
