## **Author: Narrator and Author - Swap fields**

[open .mta file]()

This action will swap the "Artist" field with the "Composer" fields. This is useful when you have the narrator's name and the author's name reversed.
*Example:*
Below, on the left, the narrator and the author of "Alice in Wonderland" are reversed. **Lewis Carroll**  is the author. Let's set it as Artist, and put **Alice Gerstenberg** as the Narrator.  Let's fix that with one simple click.

Prologue pulls Narrator info from the "Composer" field. So, keep that in mind when using MP3Tag so that it works as you want it to:



|                    | **INFO** | **FIELD EQUIVALENCE** |
|--------------------|----------|-----------------------|
| Who wrote the book | Author   | "Artist"              |
| Who reads the book | Narrator | "Composer"            |   

The end result should look something like this when browsing your books from your iPhone.
