## **Author - Capitalize**
**Pretty self-explanatory.**
<br>_converts_
<br>sir arthur conan doyle  -> Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

## **Author - Capitalize and clean**
On top of capitalizing letters, it also removes (what I believe to be) clutter from some names.
words like:

1. PhD
2. MD
3. Sir
4. Sr
5. Mr
6. Ms

You can add your own rules to the action.

<br>_converts_
<br>sir arthur conan doyle  ->Arthur Conan Doyle
